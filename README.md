# Configure Xbox Adaptive Controller as Joystick to Mouse Converter

The Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC) can convert joystick input from a USB
joystick compatible with the XAC to mouse movement output. Joystick buttons can
be configured as mouse left, middle, and right buttons. If the joystick does
not have buttons, it is possible to plug in AT switches into the XAC input
jacks. The switches can be configured as mouse buttons.

Be sure to upgrade the XAC firmware to the latest version. Use the Xbox
Accessories app which is available on Xbox consoles and Windows.

The following shows a mouse profile. When a joystick is plugged into the left
USB port, the first joystick button works as the mouse left click button.  The
second joystick button works as the mouse right click button. In the case of
the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, the front trigger button is the mouse left click.
The side thumb trigger button is the mouse right click.

The XAC can also output keyboard key presse. For example, the direction pad can
be configured to send keyboard WASD. This can be used to play Windows games
that does not work with the XAC gamepad.
